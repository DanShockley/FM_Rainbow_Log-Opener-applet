# FM_Rainbow_Log-Opener-applet
A simple AppleScript applet that opens a FileMaker Import.log file in same folder using fmrl (FM_Rainbow_Log) in a new Terminal window.

You can get FM_Rainbow_Log at https://github.com/jwillinghalpern/fm_rainbow_log

To install, you can just download and unzip the "fmrl on This Folder.app.zip" file found in the "compiled applet" folder, if you don't want to see the code first. If you do want to see the code and compile it yourself, you can clone this repo, open the source file in Script Editor, and create your own applet using Script Editor's Save function (pretty easy to do). 

Note that after you download it, you should probably move it out of the Downloads folder, since running it there might get a strange macOS security error. Also, the first time you open it on your Mac, the system will ask you whether or not to allow it to automate Terminal. After you approve the applet, you can copy that approved applet into other folders, as needed, and should not (usually) be asked to authorize the copies again. Note that you can also view the code of the applet using Script Editor _before_ you double-click to open it, by either dragging the applet onto Script Editor's icon, or by opening it from Script Editor.
