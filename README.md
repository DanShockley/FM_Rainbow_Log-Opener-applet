# FM_Rainbow_Log-Opener-applet
A simple AppleScript applet that opens a FileMaker Import.log file in same folder using fmrl (FM_Rainbow_Log) in a new Terminal window.

Note that the first time you open it on your Mac, the system will ask you whether or not to allow it to automate Terminal. After you approve the applet, you can copy that approved applet into other folders, as needed, and should not (usually) be asked to authorize the copies again.

You can get FM_Rainbow_Log at https://github.com/jwillinghalpern/fm_rainbow_log
